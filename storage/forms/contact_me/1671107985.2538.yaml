what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "You don&#039;t owe the collector or the original creditor a single red cent! It&rsquo;s all canceled debt. \r\n \r\nWe&rsquo;ve all been there. A collection company calls our phone demanding payment for a debt we never got from them. \r\n \r\nThese collection companies make millions of dollars every year by taking advantage of people. \r\n \r\nIf you have debts in collection, don&rsquo;t feel guilty or ashamed. The original creditor already got paid by the insurance and the debt was reported to the IRS as a loss. You don&rsquo;t owe them anything. In fact, the IRS could demand taxes from you because the IRS considers the canceled debt as income. \r\n \r\nIf you have any debt or you&rsquo;re being sued, contact us, we&rsquo;ll help you eliminate the debt and get the collectors off your back! \r\n \r\nFor a free consultation, visit: https://thedebtwrecker.com \r\n \r\nAct Today! \r\n \r\nFor a free consultation, visit: thedebtwrecker (dot) com \r\nOr text or call: 813 535 78 two zero \r\n \r\nTalk Soon! \r\nThe Debt Elimination Team"
