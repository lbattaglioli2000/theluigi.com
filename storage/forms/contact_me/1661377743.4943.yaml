what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Hello, my name is Jenn Roberts and I just wanted to let you know about a new article we published on our blog about Torro Pictory.ai. Pictory is a popular software that uses artificial inteligence to turn your esisting website content into videos.\r\n\r\nVideo is currently the most pushed content on social media, and people are getting tons of views &amp; web traffic from just uploading short 30-second clips to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, &amp; TikTok.\r\n\r\nMaybe you&#039;ll like it, maybe you&#039;ll hate it, or maybe you&#039;ll wonder why the heck I contacted you to tell you about it. But if you want to check it out you can find it here: https://bit.ly/3CoSmsO\r\n\r\nIf that&#039;s not your thing, then just have a good day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopt out of future communications: https://contact.automateddigitalmarketer.com/opt-out?site=theluigi.com"
