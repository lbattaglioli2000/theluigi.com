what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Hey mate,\r\nI&#039;m an internet marketer and I was hired to do website optimization for one of your competitors.\r\nI wanted to let you know that there is another website pretending to be you guys and they have purchased a very similar domain with just a slight change; they&rsquo;re using your info and they are scamming people&hellip;\r\nBut I noticed that their website recently expired, and I&#039;m writing to you guys to let you know so that you can acquire the domain name as soon as possible before these guys renew their domain and continue scamming your potential clients.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to check where they purchased the domain from and send you the link to buy the domain, just fill out this form: \r\n\r\n&gt;   https://bit.ly/GoToForm"
