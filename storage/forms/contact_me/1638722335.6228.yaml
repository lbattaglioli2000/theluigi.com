Entering the international markets. \r\n \r\nUndeniable advantages: \r\n \r\n1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all messages arrive in the inbox. When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to five percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by feedback forms it is possible to send a few million letters per day to inbox folders. When sending mass e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inboxes, all the remaining ones often either are not delivered or arrive in the junk. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mails because it is sent from different sites. When sending e-mail newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done will be in &quot;BAN&quot;. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the very little amount of macro-synonims is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending mass e-mails, it is necessary to use &laquo;macros&raquo; (synonyms) for each word and create thousands various headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many companies deliberatelly hide their email and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending bulk e-mails, your cooperation offer is delivered to every employee of the company, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by contact forms where the message is received at the electronic address specifically set up for commercial offers. \r\n \r\n7.Fifty % of corporate emails are located on free e-mail servers, they are poorly &quot;searchable&quot; by e-mail address, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these e-mail servers, all letters are 100-percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only 30%-40% of organisations are published in the directories within 2-3 years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your cooperation  offers. \r\nIt turns out that that e-mails of organisations from directories are spammed, and therefore they will not have such result as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new VOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the headings or body of the letter can be sent through forms. When sending e-mail newsletters, such messages either do not reach the recipient or arrive in spam. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all words and phrases that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1.

We offer customers that you will not find through other advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your customers, that is impossible to &quot;break through&quot; automatically in any other way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to send a business offer to those potential customers that were earlier out of reach due to e-mail filters while sending bulk e-mails. \r\nNow, there is a very paradoxical situation: companies in the directories are literally filled with spam with all sorts of business offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. \r\n \r\n8.

This e-mail is also set up for cell phones as it is necessary to respond to the information very fast so as not to lose the application or the relevance of the commercial offer. \r\n \r\n11. The database of every country also includes all joint firms from all countries of the world working with or closely related to this country, for instance, diasporas and national communities. \r\nBan, sanctions of search engines and mail systems? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending e-mail newsletters, therefore search sanctions and &quot;Ban&quot; do not apply to them. \r\nMail delivers the data of letters to the inbox folder, as it goes through the &quot;warm communication channel&quot; from the new IP address of the website to the corporate email of the same site. \r\nIn other words, these mailings &quot;live in e-mails&quot; and filters of mail systems do not respond to them, because mail systems have great trust in communication channels between sites and corporate electronic addresses. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\n \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a message by contact form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAINS AND COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN ORDER FOR MAILING BY CONTACT FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text + a few headings, the main goal is to interest the potential customer, and they will read the rest on your internet resource. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search engine and choose the most successful ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted randomly from text file. \r\nOnly messages in the text form are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all &quot;clickable&quot;.
