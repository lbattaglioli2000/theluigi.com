what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "My name is Ira Turner, and I&#039;m an ERC consultant. I&#039;m not selling anything at all, you have my word. I just wanted to talk to you about getting your employee retention refund...up to $26K per employee. It won&#039;t cost you a dime.\r\n \r\nPerhaps you&#039;ve seen all of the commercials and ads about the IRS giving away massive, nonrepayable refunds, to small businesses with 5 or more employees, impacted by COVID during 2020 &amp; 2021.\r\n \r\nIf you&#039;re skeptical - don&#039;t be - its absolutely true. However, this has brought scammers out in droves.\r\nThere are only a few legitimate companies helping small businesses get these massive refunds which they never have to repay. http://www.RefundsNow.org is one of them. You&#039;ll find all of the details there. It&#039;ll take less than 2 minutes to submit your application. Again, that&#039;s http://www.RefundsNow.org\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like for me to help you submit your application, just call or text me at 888-400-8898. Thanks."
