A lot of firms try to hide their e-mail address and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending bulk e-mails, your commercial offer is delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the message is received at the email specifically set up for business offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of corporate mailboxes are placed on free mail servers, they are not very &quot;searchable&quot; by mailbox, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these mail servers, all messages are 100-percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of businesses get into the directories within 2-3 years, and all the rest are already placed in our VOIS databases and are waiting for your business offers. \r\nIt turns out that that e-mails of organisations from directories are full of spam, and therefore they will not have such profit as when sending mailing by contact forms using our new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9.
