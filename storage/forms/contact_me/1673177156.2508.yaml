what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Hello there and Happy New Year!\r\n\r\nMy name is James Brown and I have been working with HR professionals to help businesses understand and take advantage of the employee retention credit.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for ways to retain your valuable employees and reduce your tax burden during these challenging times\r\n\r\nOur team can help you take advantage of the employee retention credit (ERC).\r\n\r\nIt is a valuable tax credit that is designed to help businesses retain their employees and continue paying wages during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n The ERC is equal to 50% of the qualified wages that an eligible employer pays to its employees, and the maximum credit for the full year is $26,000 per employee. \r\n\r\nThis means that your business can potentially receive a credit of up to $26,000 per employee for qualified wages paid during the year.\r\n\r\nIf you apply today we&#039;ll be able to help you determine if your business is eligible for the ERC and assist you with the process of claiming the credit. \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t miss out on this opportunity to get financial relief and retain your valuable employees. \r\n\r\nPlease Make Sure You Apply Today Before Midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://snip.ly/ev277m\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJames Brown"
