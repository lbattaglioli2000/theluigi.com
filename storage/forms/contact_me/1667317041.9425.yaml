It&rsquo;s rare to get such a quick and fast personalized message to an audience with that kind of speed.\r\n\r\n2. Immediate results\r\nYou will instantly be able to see those who have received it, along with other analytical data such as those who have opened it, read it and of course, the important one, which is those who have responded.\r\n\r\n3. Personal\r\nBecause it&rsquo;s directly sent to each individual client, SMS is a very personal message. Mobile phones are very personal devices, so people will often respond with more personal immediacy. You can improve this still further by delivering it as a personal message to each individual. This is sure to grab their attention.\r\n\r\nPotential customers are far more likely to give you an email address than they are their mobile phone number, so yes you need to keep an email list too. But this demonstrates how personal most people take their phone number to be. Once you have a phone number, it&rsquo;s likely that customers will be more responsive to your messaging because they invited you in.\r\n\r\n4. Cost-effective\r\nText messages are cheap especially if you buy them in bulk. No other marketing method provides such affordable results, particularly if compared with traditional marketing methods, such as TV, radio or print media.     \r\n\r\n5. Simple and easy\r\nDue to its simplicity and reach, SMS has become a globally adopted communication channel. Everyone knows how to open, read and text a message. Moreover, thanks to the limitation in length (160 characters), messages are small, direct, concise and go straight to the point. And who doesn&rsquo;t like it sweet &amp; simple?\r\n\r\n6. Global marketing\r\nText messages are designed to reach anyone who has a reasonably modern mobile device and a cell phone signal. So you can reach millions of people in an instant, anytime, anywhere.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s estimated there are up to 7 billion mobile phones in daily use today, so SMS is one of the few technologies that are universally synced between all of the global mobile phone operators. You can reach the world with text messaging.\r\n\r\n7. Direct delivery\r\nSMS is among the most direct ways of communicating with clients, besides meeting face-to-face and a direct phone call. Since the other 2 can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive, it&rsquo;s clear who&rsquo;s the winner!\r\n\r\n8. Precise\r\nOnce you have your audience segmented, then you can accurately target groups of customers with a variety of marketing messages. Understanding what works and what doesn&rsquo;t means you can refine your approach to maximize sales potential.\r\n\r\n9. Efficient\r\nThe ability to schedule text messages means that you can save time in planning your campaign, you don&rsquo;t need to write each message individually, so groups of people can be targeted with scheduled texts.\r\n\r\nThis then provides more time to spend on other areas of the business, or indeed, managing the bulk of sales opportunities that will come back from your SMS delivery very soon after sending.\r\n\r\n10. Trackable and analytics\r\nSMS can easily be trackable too, most providers offer delivery reports which can be a great source for interrogating what successes you&rsquo;ve had with your SMS deliveries, so you can fully and accurately rate the success of your campaigns. You can then take lessons learned into the next campaign.\r\n\r\n11. Reliable\r\nMobile phones don&rsquo;t generally come with a spam filter, let alone a spam box. Mostly as mobile phone SMS messages are generally safer than email which can deliver all kinds of shady attachments. Plus, delivery occurs within a 48 hour period to allow for phones being switched off or out of range of a signal.\r\n\r\nSo, for the most part, you know delivery by SMS is a reliable form of inboxing your customers. At worst, you might get your phone number blocked. But then that can be down to your message and your audience.\r\n\r\n12. SMS vs email\r\nSMS text messages have a far higher &ldquo;open rate&rdquo; than email. Plus, with email, you could be sending your emails to clients that long assigned your name to the junk box. If your text messages aren&rsquo;t delivered, then there is feedback on that through the medium.\r\n\r\nEmails, of course, have their place and are still extremely effective in communicating with customers and increasing sales opportunities, as people say, &ldquo;the money is in the list!&rdquo;. But SMS is actually quicker, and safer overall.\r\n\r\nArmed with those undeniable advantages, let&rsquo;s assume you like the idea and are probably wondering how you would go about setting up this system. So let&rsquo;s dive into that by setting an appointment with our onboarding team\r\n\r\nhttps://bravooffer.com/smstextback\r\n\r\nAll the best, \r\n\r\n\r\nOpt out here\r\nhttps://redeyedeal.com/opt-out-2954"
