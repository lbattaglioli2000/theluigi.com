what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Dear Business Owner:\r\n\r\nRead EVERY WORD of This EMAIL &ndash; \r\nYou Can Thank Me Later -\r\n\r\nJohn Richards here with Express Tax Pros.\r\n\r\nYou might be aware of the Government&#039;s PPP Program where qualifying businesses received Funds to help them retain their employees as a part of the CARES Act.\r\nThe program has been expanded and now the more generous ERTC Fund program has been revised so more businesses qualify and can receive potentially up to $26,000 PER W-2 EMPLOYEE.  \r\n\r\nThe time to apply is NOW!\r\n\r\nWe work with an accounting firm that specializes in assisting businesses with the application process to ensure that they get all the money they qualify for.  For example, did you know that if you provided health care benefits to your employee and their family, that the funds paid out for those benefits also count as wages in the calculations.   That is why our expert accounting team is getting some sizable checks for the businesses that they work with.\r\nTo find out how much your business potentially qualifies for, just go to this website, and take 1 minute to fill out the simple initial inquiry form to see what your business qualifies to receive.\r\n\r\nwww.expresstaxpros.com\r\n\r\nAny business owner that has W-2 employees and was affected by Covid-19 probably has a nice government check waiting for them, BUT you have to apply to get it.\r\nGo to the website NOW to apply &ndash; you will be glad you did.\r\n\r\nwww.expresstaxpros.com\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions and let me know that you applied.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJohn Richards\r\nIf you would like to opt out of future messages, please email your domain name to optout@expresstaxpros.net"
