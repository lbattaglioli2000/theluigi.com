what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Hi there, \r\n \r\nWould you possibly have the ability to take on another handful of customers on a regular basis - 1-5 a month, maybe more? \r\n \r\nOr are you already full? \r\n \r\nIf you&rsquo;ve the space, this explains it best: \r\n \r\nhttps://skochy.com/customer-flow \r\n \r\nChoose the level you want, depending on how much extra business you can handle. \r\n \r\nSaw you didn&rsquo;t already have one of these, hence I&rsquo;m getting in touch. We&rsquo;ve done this with thousands of local businesses across the US, and it&rsquo;s been working fantastically well for them. \r\n \r\nMy number is below, but if you need clarification, probably best you reply to this email. \r\n \r\nNo problem if you&rsquo;re already too busy, please disregard this message. \r\n \r\nThanks anyway, \r\n \r\nScott Craig Stevens \r\nOffice: 347-627-0937"
