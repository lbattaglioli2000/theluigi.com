what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "I found something you might want to see.\r\n\r\nThis business got sued for the same problem that you have on your website.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hotels-ada-compliance-20181111-story.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI detect similar issues on your site but would need your permission to run a complete scan to find exactly what needs to be fixed to bring your site into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\r\n\r\nThere is no fee for this for scan, and I&rsquo;ll provide a summary of changes that need to be made, also at no charge just text me your website at (619) 500-2853 or scan your free website report here: https://bit.ly/ADA-Bundle \r\n\r\n\r\nDid you know that if your website is not ADA compliant, you risk fines of up to $100,000 for the first offense alone?\r\n\r\nMy hope is that you will be better prepared should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, and that this gesture would warm you to seriously consider making these changes.\r\n\r\nPlease don&rsquo;t hesitate to text me at (619) 500-2853 if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks &amp; Regards,\r\nArmando Suarez\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to opt-out of communication with us, visit:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/websiteoptout"
