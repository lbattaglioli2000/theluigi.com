what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "Dear Business Owner:\r\n\r\nWas your business affected by the pandemic like most of us?\r\n\r\nIf so, there is a program called ERC that allows us to claim up to $26,000\r\nIn tax credits per qualified W-2 employee.\r\n\r\nIt was passed as part of the CARES ACT in 2020 and was meant to assist the business\r\nowners with retaining employees. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most business owners don&rsquo;t know it exists which is why we are trying to\r\nget the word out.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to qualify for and can result in a very significant check\r\nFrom the IRS.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;d like to find out if your business qualifies, click the link below to complete our short\r\nERC Questionnaire and we will reach out to discuss options.  https://ertcboss.com\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nNeal \r\nERTC Specialist\r\n\r\nhttps://ertcboss.com"
