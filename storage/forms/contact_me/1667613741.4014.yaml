what_d_you_wanna_talk_about: "The only way to really know is to look for the NSF Label on all your supplement products. If it does nt have the NSF label, just say no!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an NSF facility / FDA Registered Facility and Why These are Important?\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, going to the store is not all about picking up what you need, paying for it, and heading back home. You have to research and check\r\n the ingredients. Manufacturers are chasing sales and cutting losses by using highly processed ingredients, some of which might have adverse long-term effects.\r\n\r\nMost companies are FDA-approved. But for brands that take extra precautions and value the well-being and safety of their customers, \r\nfor instance fixing brand alignment issues, NSF certification is the gold standard. Only a handful of companies meet the requirements of NSF certification, and ours is one of them. \r\n\r\nWhat is NSF? \r\n\r\nThe National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) is a third-party testing and validation foundation that has been in operation since 1944. The foundation has grown\r\n in popularity among consumers and manufacturers because of its strict measures and dedication to improving global human health.\r\n\r\nWhile the FDA is highly regarded, the NSF is the GOLD STANDARD in terms of consumer safety. Its standards help to protect food, water, consumer \r\nproducts, and the environment through testing, auditing, and certifying products and systems.\r\n\r\nWhat is an NSF Facility? \r\n\r\nAn NSF facility is any facility that has qualified and received NSF certification. In some cases, you might notice facilities that claim to have \r\ngoods &ldquo;tested to NSF standards.&rdquo; This is not the same or equal to having NSF certification. \r\n\r\nTo have NSF certification, the facility needs to; \r\n\r\nHave their claims of reduced contaminants in their products and production lines verified and proven.\r\nTheir systems must be tested to ensure they don&rsquo;t add harmful products to the water or foods that they process or handle.\r\nThe facility must have structurally sound systems that meet the stringent measures and requirements of the NSF.\r\nThe advertising literature and labeling used in the products are verified and accurate.\r\nThe materials and production processes are thoroughly tested to guarantee quality products over time.\r\nIt is not enough that a brand claims to have products&rsquo; tested to NSF standards&rsquo;; these claims have to be verified. Vava&rsquo;s nutritional supplements are produced\r\n in an NSF-certified facility meaning all the claims like being vegan-friendly, non-GMO, Cruelty-free, and organic are verified and validated. Our customers have \r\ncomplete confidence in the value they get inside our supplement bottles. \r\n\r\nHow Do You Know If a Product and Facility is NSF Certified? \r\n\r\nSimple! All NSF-certified products and facilities carry the NSF mark. The mark is a symbol of assurance the packaging claims are accurate and work as expected. \r\n\r\nThat means you no longer have to worry about going through the confusing ingredients list, or the misleading marketing literature. All you need to do is check for the NSF mark. \r\n\r\nWhy is it essential for consumers to check for NSF certification?\r\n\r\nWith the rampant food safety outbreaks and recalls, taking care of your body and guaranteeing the hygiene and care used to make consumer products or foods is becoming harder. \r\n\r\nBrands are becoming more deceptive in a bid to increase market share, and increasingly dangerous ingredients are finding their way into your foods.\r\n\r\nWe understand that your health and overall well-being are your focal points. That&rsquo;s why all our supplements and health support products are produced in an NSF-registered CGMP facility. Why is this important? \r\n\r\nNSF-registered Facilities build trust\r\n \r\nConsumer trust is at an all-time low. More than half of the customers aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the information available on product labels. \r\n\r\nOne of the ways brands can build trust with their customers is by including trusted certifications on their product packaging and labeling. \r\n\r\nBeing an independent public health organization, NSF is one of the most credible sources, and its blue symbol is recognized globally. \r\n\r\nNSF Facilities are Health code compliant \r\n\r\nHealthy living is more than the food you eat. It&rsquo;s also about the appliances and products you use to prepare your food. Even though not everything in your kitchen needs to be NSF certified, NSF certified appliances meet and exceed the standards of quality and health set by local, state, and federal health codes. \r\n\r\nFor restaurateurs and other business operators that require frequent inspection, the NSF certification mark is a quick hint to inspectors of compliance and quality. \r\n\r\nThe NSF symbol represents consumer protection \r\n\r\nThe CDC estimates that over 48 million people contract foodborne illnesses annually. Up to 128,000 of those require medical attention in a hospital around 3,000 people die from such complications. \r\n\r\nThese are bone-chilling numbers. Poorly designed equipment is mainly to blame for the cross-contamination and endangering of millions of lives.\r\n\r\nThe checks and balances done by the NSF are aimed to reduce the risk of contamination by ensuring food-grade equipment and food produce are handled in the proper environment using safety equipment. The NSF symbol only appears on foods and consumer products that pass these checks, meaning the chances of cross-contamination are lower.\r\n\r\nAccuracy: You get what&rsquo;s on the label\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s common practice for brands to exaggerate what&rsquo;s on offer. Consumers are up in arms, taking drastic measures to adopt healthier lifestyles. Brands take note of this and label their products accordingly. As you might have noticed, in most cases, the labeling is misleading.\r\n\r\nWith consumer products that carry the NSF symbol, the claims on the labeling and packaging are verified and validated. If you buy bread with a label indicating &ldquo;made with real carrots,&rdquo; then the bread contains real carrots as an ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe NSF mark symbolizes truth and transparency in the claims on the product label. \r\n\r\nThe Takeaway \r\n\r\nGetting NSF certification is not easy. There is a ton of qualifications and standards that have to be met. In some states, it&rsquo;s a requirement that specific equipment, especially those used in the restaurant business, be approved and certified by NSF International. There&rsquo;s also a seven-step process that products must pass through to meet the NSF criteria. \r\n\r\nGood health is your most valuable asset, and you should guard it jealously. That&rsquo;s why we find it necessary to go through the stringent NSF measures to provide you with products that not only support your body in being the best it can be but also made from the best practices that are safe for the environment as well. \r\n\r\nSorry guys, nothing to sell you in this email. Just education. Hope You have a safe and happy hiliday season, and only buy supplements form NSF approved facilities.\r\nMany Of Our Customers Get great results when they add carb cycling to their routine.
