The Chocolate Milk Mile is an event that he''s putting on to celebrate the life of Noah Farrelly, who loved running but unfortunately was struck and killed by a car while he was running. The site looks pretty simple, but there''s some pretty cool stuff goin'' on behind the scene. Stay tuned for a technical post talking about that site''s inner-workings.'

However, it''s spring break and there''s a pandemic that''s seemingly caused the entire world to shut down. Because of it, I have another week of break, Apple closed all of its stores until further notice, and nobody can go to restaurants. So with all this going on, I''ve had nothing but free time these past few days.'

I wanted it to be more minimal than my previous design which was full of hot pink and bright colors. Secondly, I want to actually write more content, because I certainly have been lacking. I really want to start writing more technical articles to share what I know, and to learn more. I also want to write more about cooking. I want to share recipes and techniques I''ve learned, and instill my love for food in others.'

Granted it''s still in beta and will probably break, it''s a powerful system and I''m willing to chance it. Statamic really makes content creation and management a cinch, and will enable me to focus on creating more content, so stay tuned for more goodies.'
